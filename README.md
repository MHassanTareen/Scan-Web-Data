#Scan Web Data
This repository contains Python scripts designed for scanning and processing web data using Machine Learning Techniques (MLT). The scripts are focused on data extraction, duplicate detection, and data storage functionalities.

Contents
dataCheck.py: This script provides functionality to check and preprocess data stored in Excel files. It includes features like detecting duplicate entries and replacing them with the latest ones.

scrapedata.py: This script is responsible for web scraping using the BeautifulSoup library. It extracts data from a specified website, stores it in an Excel file, and allows for continuous scanning through pagination or "view more" links.

xleSave.py: Contains utility functions for saving data to an Excel file and counting the number of entries in the Excel file.

Usage
